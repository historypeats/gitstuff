# Hooks
These are useful hooks for dev

## Pre Push

- pre-push.member prevent pushing to master. This is useful for team members who should not be pushing to master. Instead push to a new branch and make a pull request.

- pre-push.admin unlike member, admins can push to master. This simply prompts them if they are sure they want to push to master.
